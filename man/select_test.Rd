\title{Matrix factorisation test set}
\usage{
select_test(Y, r, min_row = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Matrix with missing values. Missing values should be \code{NA}}

\item{r}{Ratio i.e. proption of observations held out for testing}

\item{min_row}{The minimum observations to leave in each row. This protects against leaving an entire row missing.}
}
\description{
Select a test set to pass to \code{matrix_factorisation}
}
\details{
Implements matrix factorisation by gradient descent. Matrix \code{Y} should have \code{NA}'s as missing values. The matrix will be factorised
into two matrices U and V, the user and feature matrix. The U matrix essentially contains weight each user gives to a certain feature. The
function will output the accuracy of the selected test sample by using \code{test}. See \code{select_test} for more information.

\dontrun{
m <- matrix(sample(c(NA, 1:5), 60, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, rep(0.8/5, 5))), nrow = 10)
id <- select_test(m, 0.2)
mf <- funksvd(m, 2, test = id$test)
mf$pred
